# RUSSE

**RUSSE** is series of workshops on Russian Semantic Evaluation. Each workshop is centered around a shared task on a specific topic related to the semantic processing of the Russian language.

The first workshop on [semantic relatedness and similarity](/2015/sim/) was held in 2015 in conjunction with the [Dialogue](http://dialog-21.ru/en/) conference. The second workshop is dedicated to [word sense induction and disambiguation](/2018/wsi/) and will be held in 2018 also in conjunction with the Dialogue conference.
