title: Preprint for the RUSSE'2018 WSI&D Task
---

We published a preprint for our upcoming [Dialogue 2018](http://www.dialog-21.ru/) paper describing the recently conducted RUSSE [shared task](http://russe.nlpub.org/2018/wsi/) on word sense induction and disambiguation. The preprint is available at [arXiv:1803.05795](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05795). Once the Dialogue conference proceedings are out, we will update the reference.
