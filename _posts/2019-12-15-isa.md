title: A Shared Task on Taxonomy Enrichment for the Russian Language
---

Taxonomies are tree structures which organize terms into a semantic hierarchy. Taxonomic relations (or hypernyms) are “is-a” relations: cat is-a animal, banana is-a fruit, Microsoft is-a company, etc. This type of relations is useful in a wide range of natural language processing tasks for performing semantic analysis. The goal of this semantic task is to extend an existing taxonomy with relations of previously unseen words.

We invite you to participate in the shared task on taxonomy enrichment for the Russian language:
